BLANK STEVIE

This represents what has become my standard boilerplate for Sinatra
applications serving small websites.

I'm still feeling out how much it should reflect my personal biases and
tastes, so for example there are commented entries in Gemfile that I would
often use. I might tailor this more for my usage later.


Getting Started

Download the most recent release in your preferred archive format:

  https://github.com/TrevorBramble/blank-sinatra/releases

Extract the archive to wherever you want your new project. This example will
create a new subdirectory called "myproject" and extract the contents of the
blank-sinatra-1.0.0 directory inside of the tar.gz file into our new
"myproject" directory.

  $ mkdir myproject && blank-sinatra-1.0.0.tar.gz -C myproject --strip=1

  $ tree -a myproject
  myproject
  ├── app.rb
  ├── config.ru
  ├── Gemfile
  ├── Gemfile.lock
  ├── .ruby-gemset
  └── .ruby-version

  0 directories, 6 files

From there treat it just like any other new Sinatra app, using Git, Bundler,
whichever Ruby versioning tool you prefer, etc.


Contributing

There are smarter ways to approach this, by modularizing it all and using a
some additional code to produce the resulting kit, but the idea here is to
create a simple, static set of files that the majority (80%?) of Sinatra
projects will all share.

That said, I encourage and welcome feedback on what should or shouldn't be
included, or how something is included, especially when that feedback is in
the form of a pull request.
